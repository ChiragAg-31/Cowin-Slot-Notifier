In this course we will learn about how to create Node.js based CLI -Command Line Interface. We will be learning this by actually building one. So, what will we build? We will be building a COVID-19 vaccination slots tracker using CLI. This will call the live api and return the different slots available in your choice of district. 

The only pre-requisite’s which I believe is you should know basics of Javascript and understand Node.js.

While building this CLI we will use and learn about the follow node package manager-npm

- Axios –for calling the different api’s.
- Chalk – for beautifying the console output.
- Commander – giving the different options and command in CLI such as cowin states or cowin districts stateid
- Inquirer – for getting user input for entering the age filter.
- Node-notifier – send desktop notification.
- Tty-table – format our table output

Our CLI will perform the follow functions.

- Ability to get all states and id’s.
- Ability to get all district id's for a state id.
- Ability to get slots by district id.
- Ability to filter slots by ages as we have slots by 18-45 and 45 and above.
- Apart from this beautification of the console output 
- Ability to send desktop notification
